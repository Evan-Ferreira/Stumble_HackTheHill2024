The inspiration behind Stumble came from those around us we came to the realization that dating, much like coding, is a skill that can be improved with practice. We wanted to create a platform that merges the structure of a learning tool like LeetCode with real-world dating scenarios, providing users with a space to hone their conversational abilities. By gamifying the dating process, we aim to help people feel more confident and prepared for meaningful connections.
